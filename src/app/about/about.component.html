    <p>
    I'm a brazilian biologist who found her second passion in programming. I started learning how to code years ago, but decided to pursue it
    professionally when I came to live in Belgium. I have good skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, React and Redux. I'm currently teaching myself
    Typescript and Angular. I'm always interested in learning new technologies.
